Revision history for Perl extension DBIx::HTML::PopupRadio.

1.07  Mon Apr 28 21:31:00 2003
	- Backticks with redirection of STDERR failed in Module::MakeDist V 1.04 when making
		V 1.06 of this module, so I've had to re-make then both

1.06  Mon Apr 28 09:09:00 2003
	- The constructor now takes a 'javascript' parameter, whose value is, say, an event handler
	- A sample would be: 'onChange = "replicate()"'. See the POD for details

1.05  Sun Mar 23 11:29:00 2003
	- No source code changes in this version
	- Patch to stop shipping blib/ directory in Unix distros, because the
		PAUSE indexer takes this directory to indicate a binary distro,
		which means it does not index the module, and this in turn means
		the module is not listed in the CPAN daily update list, etc.

1.04  Wed Dec 11 12:53:57 2002
	- Minor documentation changes. No need to upgrade

1.03  Mon Nov 18 12:53:57 2002
	- Fix sub radio_group so that if there is no default,
		the items are counted, and the first becomes the default.
		This was the plan all along, but it was so clear in my
		mind I did not transfer the logic to the code

1.02  Sat Oct 26 14:29:00 2002
	- Minor documentation changes. No need to upgrade

1.01  Tue Oct 15 11:41:13 2002
	- Change the meaning of the 'default' parameter so it refers
		to the visible menu item and not the value associated with
		the visible menu item. This now matches the meaning of the
		'default' parameter used in DBIx::HTML::ClientDB
	- Add a primitive test program t/test.t
	- Minor documentation changes

1.00  Sat Sep 28 12:37:29 2002
	- original version
